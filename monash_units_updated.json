This presentation will provide their interpretation of the background behind the project and the techniques required to conduct the research project.\n\nThe preparation of the mini-thesis throughout the candidature will be guided closely by the supervisor at all times.\nCoursework activities (PSC4111) will be conducted jointly to support the progression of the research work and the preparation of the final thesis. The final oral presentation is the culmination of the year's work and should reflect the findings obtained, the students' interpretation of these and the conclusion they draw from their investigations.",
